#There are 4 major principles that make an language Object Oriented. These are Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance.
#Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods.
#Inheritance means we can derived method/class code and reuse it from existing methods/classes
#Polymorphism means we can create many forms of a single method there are 2 types of polymorphism 1: Static 2: Dynamic
#Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and dynamic polymorphism using method overriding.
